# Project Euler solutions
(c) 2012-20xx Alex Clemmer

## Hello, Hacker School.

In order to prove that I like programming, and am not terrible at it, in the last 2 days I have: (1) written a lexer for Python, (2) completed 10-ish project euler problems, and (3) studied for my finals.

## Contents

This contains solutions I developed for Project Euler problems. Many files contain *several* solutions, especially the Haskell and Ocaml solutions, since I was learning those languages at the time, and wanted to experiment with different ways of doing things, and especially, to figure out what was/was not efficient.
