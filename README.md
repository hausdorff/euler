(SSSSSSHHHH, don't tell anyone this is here. You're not supposed to show the solutions ot people!)

This contains solutions I developed for Project Euler problems. Many files contain *several* solutions, especially the Haskell and Ocaml solutions, since I was learning those languages at the time, and wanted to experiment with different ways of doing things, and especially, to figure out what was/was not efficient.
